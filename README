# Version 1.0

# About

The goal of this plugin is to do some quick benchmark of the gstreamer pipeline.
It can either measure the FPS or the time between each frame.

# Compilation

First you must make sure that your device's clock is correctly settup.
Otherwise the compilation will fail.

In the fpsCounter folder do:
    - bash autogen.sh
    - make

# Install

- sudo make install

To test if the plugin has been correctly install, do:
    - export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/
    - gst-inspect-1.0 fpscounter

If the plugin failed to install the following message will be displayed: "No such element or plugin 'fpscounter'"

# Uninstall

- sudo rm /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstfpscounter.*

# Usage

By default the plugin is installed in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0. 
It is then required to tell gstreamer where to find it with the command:
- export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/

The plugin can be used in any gstreamer pipeline by adding "fpscounter", the name of the plugin.

## Pipeline example:
- gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc aelock=true sensor-mode=0 saturation=0 ! fpscounter ! fakesink

# Plugin parameters

    - Type: boolean
    - Default value: false
